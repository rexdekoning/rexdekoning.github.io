                    <h2>Getting Started with Azure Fundamentals</h2>
                    <p>
                        Microsoft Azure is one of the leading cloud platforms, offering a vast array of services 
                        for computing, storage, networking, and more. Understanding the fundamentals is crucial 
                        for anyone looking to build or migrate applications to the cloud.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Core Azure Services</h3>
                    <p>
                        Azure provides several core services that form the foundation of most cloud solutions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Azure Virtual Machines:</strong> Scalable computing resources on-demand</li>
                        <li><strong>Azure App Service:</strong> Fully managed platform for building web apps and APIs</li>
                        <li><strong>Azure Storage:</strong> Highly available, secure, and scalable cloud storage</li>
                        <li><strong>Azure SQL Database:</strong> Managed relational database service</li>
                        <li><strong>Azure Active Directory:</strong> Identity and access management</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                    <p>
                        The best way to learn Azure is hands-on. Start with a free Azure account, which gives you 
                        $200 credit for the first 30 days and access to many services that are always free. Begin 
                        with simple projects like deploying a web app or setting up a virtual machine, and gradually 
                        explore more advanced services.

                    <h2>Best Practices for Azure Cloud Architecture</h2>
                    <p>
                        Designing cloud solutions requires a different mindset than traditional on-premises 
                        architecture. Here are key principles for building robust Azure solutions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Design Principles</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Design for growth using auto-scaling and load balancing</li>
                        <li><strong>High Availability:</strong> Leverage Azure's availability zones and geo-redundancy</li>
                        <li><strong>Security First:</strong> Implement defense in depth with network security groups, 
                            encryption, and Azure Security Center</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Use Azure Cost Management and right-sizing recommendations</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Implement comprehensive logging with Azure Monitor and 
                            Application Insights</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Well-Architected Framework</h3>
                    <p>
                        Microsoft's Azure Well-Architected Framework provides five pillars for excellent architecture:
                        Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency, Reliability, and Security. 
                        Following these principles ensures your Azure solutions are production-ready and maintainable.

                    <h2>Implementing DevOps Practices with Azure</h2>
                    <p>
                        Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions provide powerful tools for implementing continuous integration 
                        and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Modern software development requires automation 
                        to deliver quality code quickly and reliably.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Azure DevOps Services</h3>
                    <p>
                        Azure DevOps offers a complete suite of development tools:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Azure Repos:</strong> Git repositories for source control</li>
                        <li><strong>Azure Pipelines:</strong> CI/CD pipelines for any platform</li>
                        <li><strong>Azure Boards:</strong> Agile project management tools</li>
                        <li><strong>Azure Artifacts:</strong> Package management for dependencies</li>
                        <li><strong>Azure Test Plans:</strong> Manual and exploratory testing tools</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Infrastructure as Code</h3>
                    <p>
                        Managing infrastructure as code is essential for modern DevOps. Azure Resource Manager (ARM) 
                        templates, Bicep, and Terraform allow you to define your infrastructure declaratively, 
                        ensuring consistency across environments and enabling version control for your infrastructure.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Automation Best Practices</h3>
                    <p>
                        Successful DevOps implementation requires automated testing at every stage, from unit tests 
                        to integration and performance testing. Use Azure Pipelines to automate builds, run tests, 
                        and deploy to multiple environments. Implement blue-green deployments or canary releases to 
                        minimize risk when deploying new versions.
